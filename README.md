## üîßImplementations

We provide two implementations based on [MMDetection](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection) and [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/). For better scalability and simpler environment configuration, I will mainly maintain the implementation based on pure PyTorch, which is more recommended to use.

- [CANet based on MMDetection](CANet-MMDetection/README.md)
- [CANet based on pure PyTorch](CANet-pytorch/README.md)

## Update

- [2024.7.5] Add the implementation of CANet based on pure PyTorch.
- [2023.3.27] [Paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0031320323002583) is accepted to [Pattern Recognition](https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/pattern-recognition), code is available.
